Absolutely! This is a fantastic way to level up your DevOps journey â€” building a polyglot microservices architecture with React + Java + MySQL, alongside your existing Node.js services.

Weâ€™ll build a new Java microservice that:

Serves dynamic text from a MySQL database
Exposes a REST API (GET /api/text)
Is consumed by your React frontend
Is production-ready in design (logging, config, health checks, etc.)
And weâ€™ll do it step-by-step, with clear explanations so you learn Java and deployment along the way â€” even if youâ€™ve never written Java before.

<p>âœ… Final Goal
Your React frontend will display:

This is a Java micro-service. This text is from the MySQL DB.
...but the text comes from a MySQL database, served via a Java Spring Boot microservice.

ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Guide: Java Microservice with MySQL
Weâ€™ll go through:

<p>âœ… Setting up the Java project</p>
<p>âœ… Writing the Java code (Spring Boot)</p>
<p>âœ… Configuring MySQL</p>
<p>âœ… Testing locally</p>
<p>âœ… Dockerizing it</p>
<p>âœ… How React will consume it</p>
<p>âœ… DevOps notes for production</p>
Letâ€™s begin!

ðŸ”§ Step 1: Set Up the Java Project (No Prior Java Knowledge Needed)
Weâ€™ll use Spring Initializr to generate a starter project.

Go to: https://start.spring.io

Fill in:

- Project: Maven
- Language: Java
- Spring Boot:3.x (latest stable)
- Group: com.example
- Artifact: javatextservice
- Name: javatextservice
- Packaging: Jar
- Java Version: 17 (recommended)

Add Dependencies (Click "Add" under Dependencies):
<p>âœ… Spring Web (for REST APIs)</p>
<p>âœ… Spring Data JPA (to talk to MySQL)</p>
<p>âœ… MySQL Driver</p>
<p>âœ… Spring Boot Actuator (for health checks â€“ production best practice)</p>

Click "Generate", download the ZIP, and extract it.
